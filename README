When the plugin is enabled, button “Send review to Publons” will emerge at all Reviewers pages. As reviewer clicks on this button, the review data is sent to Publons automatically and reviewer receives an invitation to claim it (or it is automatically added if reviewer has profile with Publons and opted in to automatically add reviews from partnered journals). Publons website certifies only the fact of completing peer review for the current journal. The text of the review can be disclosed on Publons website only after publication of the article. To disclose the text of the review reviewer should input the DOI of published article on Publons.
